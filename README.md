islandoverlord
==============

One of my bigger and more complicated java applet games. This is a Sims-eque game where the user plays as a "god" or "ruler" of a self sustaining island. The villagers interact with the natural elements of the island. As god you can decide the fate of these villagers with god powers. Graphics were hand drawn via GIMP. No external libraries or frameworks were used.
